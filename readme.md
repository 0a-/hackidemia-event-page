# Quickstart
Install dependency before starting the server:
```
npm install
node init.js
```
(make sure you already have mongoDB running)

# Initialization 

If you are running the app for the first time, you'd be redirected to `/init` for some start-up configuration.

After initialization, `.env` and `data_seeding.js` files would be created: this is when
your app is ready to be deployed.

#Admin Panel
You can log into the admin panel (by visiting `/keystone`) after initilaization. The admin panel is where you can add & update events, mentors, and diffferent sections of the website.
